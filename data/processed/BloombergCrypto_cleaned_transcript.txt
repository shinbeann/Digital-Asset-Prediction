foreign i m stacey marie ismail managing editor of crypto for bloomberg news and this is bloomberg crypto a daily bloomberg iheart podcast it s tuesday march 14th here s a fact for you we re barely three months into 2023 and already crypto companies have cut thousands of jobs this year this is consistent with what s been happening in tech and finance across the board there have been multiple rounds of layoffs at places like twitter job cuts at meta and google and even at big investment banks like goldman sachs in crypto the cuts are across the board including at big names like galaxy digital genesis and chainalysis some like the beleaguered crypto friendly bank silvergate capital and lender amber group have cut as much as 40 of their workforces it s also true that some companies even in this environment are hiring among the crypto firms planning to add staff this year is circle internet financial the company behind one of the largest stablecoins when i spoke to their ceo jeremy allaire he said a big hiring focus this year will be on software developers and on expanding globally we are primarily hiring engineers and product leaders and then we are continuing to expand around the world and so we re opening up more outposts because we see there s a lot of global demand for what we do and so we want to do that but principally yeah this is all about the incredible opportunity to develop intellectual property so what does the state of hiring and firing in crypto suggest about the general health of the digital asset industry bloomberg reporter hannah miller joins me now to discuss the latest hannah welcome back to the show thank you for having me i m always of two minds when talking about things like layoffs in tech and finance and crypto because in as much as you could talk about the macroeconomic environment and interest rates fundamentally what we re talking about is people who had jobs no longer having jobs but what we ve certainly been seeing is in crypto in tech in finance there have been what feels like so many waves of layoffs we re getting into the thousands and in the case of the tech industry more broadly tens of thousands of people what are the prospects looking like in 2023 if you re a graduate coming out of stanford or somewhere are you still thinking i definitely want to work in the crypto industry yeah i think for the crypto industry it s a big wake up call i mean these layoffs have been happening for a long time now i mean they started before we saw layoffs in the mainstream tech industry as well as in finance but it s been really interesting to see just company after company within the crypto space cut further and further and there is this question of how much more can they cut you know like how how are they how are is there any more fat to trim so it s it s pretty i think it s it s been it s a very stark contrast to when when you saw that crypto was a really hot sector for people to go into you saw people leaving very cushy jobs at google meta to jump over to a crypto company to get a token bonus equity and a startup that they thought really had promise it s definitely a different story now to your point it s not just a different story it s kind of a mixed story right like we heard from jeremy allaire ceo of circle saying that they re really excited about being able to hire more developers and they re looking at global expansion where are these pockets of optimism coming from despite the broader environment you ve just described yeah well i think for some companies you know they were able to raise a lot of money during the crypto boom they have a lot of runway that they can use to last through this crypto winter so there are companies that still have cash to play with and you know they can draw in you know new hires they can you know snap up developers who maybe just got laid off of that google job and are really looking for a new opportunity so some companies are definitely still hiring and yeah hot areas are definitely developers people who specialize in security that s always a concern in crypto so i think for some startups that are just starting out having someone who knows cybersecurity who can help beef up protection on a platform that s a good person to have but yeah there still is a need for engineers among certain companies who definitely raised at big valuations and had big funding rounds during 2021 early 2022 so what i m hearing is if you re graduating or if you re one of those folks that s like i don t need to go to college because life works in your favor that way and you have technical skills then you as a person have a reason to be optimistic because that s the sort of the profile the skill set that these companies are looking for yeah i mean you might not get the cushy benefits that you would have at google or meta i mean even those companies are sort of slashing you know things like laundry at the office or you know what time you have to stay at the you know at the office to get a meal you know it s just things like that you might have to set aside even if you are going for a mainstream tech job but within crypto yeah there are still people who are very passionate about the space who are going in they re looking at programming languages that they would need to learn to work at a blockchain platform so whether it s rust or solidity those types of skills are in demand so yeah i mean i think even though the broader picture is pretty bleak like you said there are these pockets of hope where there are companies that are still hiring still looking for people let s talk about some of the companies that have laid a lot of folks off so we have this running tally of job cuts not just in crypto our colleagues in tech have one for tech layoffs our colleagues on finance these are the biggest banks that have had layoffs but the names for crypto you know it s like blockchain com 28 at one point coinbase 20 at one point crypto com 20 silvergate crypto friendly bank that s very much in the news at the moment 40 genesis 30 one of my questions for you is you know we talked several months ago at this point that these companies started with departures at the top it was like the summer of executive departures at crypto ceos were leaving ceos were leaving managing directors were leaving or being asked to leave or seizing the opportunity to spend time with their families have these layoffs filtered down into the ranks or are they still kind of concentrated in more senior people from what you can tell i think it s been a trickle down you know that this is affecting just your regular employee who is checking their email in the morning and might not know whether they there s a letter there about them leaving so it s something that s affecting all ranks within companies and it s also affecting people with technical talent too it s not just your marketing folks or the comms team or whatever it s something that s hitting people at all levels all different types of backgrounds so it ll be interesting to see going forward how crypto execs are going to handle this you know in some cases some of these companies have brand new leadership who are you know figuring out the ropes you know trying to lead these companies forward but yeah it s definitely something that we re keeping a close eye on as we report on the industry in addition to companies that have big operations in the united states you ve also been reporting on folks based in asia for example one of them being amber group who were in that category of having laid off 40 of its workforce scrapped bonuses had managers take salary cuts i think they cancelled a sponsorship deal they had with chelsea fc is it that this is a kind of a global problem are there any geographies that have been hit harder than others yeah it s been interesting to see in asia what s been happening there because the crypto regulatory environment in some ways is advancing further there you know we ve actually seen a reversal in hong kong you know in terms of their crypto policies they re actually becoming a little bit more friendly to digital digital assets you know singapore is still a hotbed for for crypto activity but yeah i mean geographies that have been hit hard you know asia has definitely seen some layoffs i mean coinbase for example is winding down operations in its japan office europe has also been hit hard i remember with amber the layoffs that were happening there they were hitting europe first before going to their offices in asia and with amber specifically it s very interesting i mean this is a company that s raised a lot of money over the years for them they grew very very quickly and kind of where they re at now is sort of is reversal they re back to their roots in a way because it s a much smaller workforce that they re dealing with it s like 2 to 300 people versus more than 1 000 when they were at their height so i think for some of these companies they grew super quickly built out their teams hired everyone when there was a bull market and now they re sort of reconsidering things and saying hey maybe i did grow a little too fast and going back to basics we ll be right back with more from bloomberg reporter hannah miller one of the capital d discourse things that are happening right now as it relates to layoffs at places like meta and twitter is this idea of tech companies and to a certain extent crypto companies trying to get rid of middle managers right and there s this narrative about middle managers they just like send emails all day they re not really doing the real work of so called engineers and they re also not the senior executives making the decisions about things the folks who are say middle managers will often point to the fact of like okay well we are the primary coordinators of the big ideas that are coming down from the c suite and the people who have to make them happen like we re helping people prioritize we re helping people ship have you seen other cycles where layoffs look like they re being used to flatten the hierarchy of companies and do these companies tend to reintroduce hierarchy in boom times or are we seeing something really different now yeah i mean i think in the past there was companies that gravitated towards flat structure i remember there were some crypto companies they didn t even have formal titles they wanted to have this sense of camaraderie you know that everybody s equal it s just about building it s not about where you rank but i think the fact of the matter is that companies like twitter are now dealing with these changing structures that they want to just streamline everything and cut out who they can and yeah the middle manager is going to be a good target for that so looking ahead it ll be interesting to see whether in the crypto space that they kind of go back to tradition and having a more structured environment just to maybe put things in perspective as they sort of right the ship here but i think corporate structure is very interesting and right now in tech and crypto there are a lot of models for it so it ll be interesting to see which ones survive and thrive and to that point about there being a lot of models you know it seems like the most consistent narrative we re hearing from a lot of crypto companies is one we re excited about hiring engineers two we re looking for growth opportunities outside of the united states and in those conversations various folks have mentioned opportunities in the uae and dubai for example and three this idea to your point of focus right like really picking an area of expertise perhaps not launching an nft marketplace that no one is asking for and really trying to identify what those core strengths are you also report a lot on the vc side of this question are you seeing kind of a similar narrowing of focus on the vc side you know you mentioned security earlier in terms of themes that they might be excited about is anything changing about their approach yeah well the pace of deals is just slowed in general you know vcs are taking their time more when they re looking at companies you know whether they want to invest in them and the other thing too is that they re looking for more traditional things they want a board seat you know they want their you know they want some sort of oversight to be in place you know so those things you re seeing a return to traditional values in venture capital when it comes to investing in crypto and yes i would say there s some increased specialization that they re looking for companies that maybe just want to narrow the focus to infrastructure or security or maybe they re specifically into gaming nfts but at the same time i have seen some vcs gravitate towards other industries including artificial intelligence because that s obviously really hot right now so i remember i was talking to a vc who was like yeah we want to hire someone who can do ai and just the whole thing by themselves yes i think they re also sort of spreading their bets as well even though they want the companies they invest in to be more specialized yeah what was the thing that folks at andreessen horowitz used to say before they blocked all the journalists on twitter software will eat the world maybe it ll be ai will eat the world and we ll see how well that turns out so more to come on that topic i m sure thank you so much hannah thank you that was bloomberg reporter hannah miller you can find more of
